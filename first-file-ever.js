// ok i successfully did it
// 1. git init

// js does not need to define a main fuction like c, c++, java, etc. You can directly write your code.

console.log("Hello World!");
// consol.log() serves as a method on printing values to the consol
// the " " are indicating the text as plain text and not as a function
// the semicolon ; shows the ending of a command

// <-- these are single line comments
// console.log("test 1")
// as you can see the command is not excecuted
// you can add it to the end of a command as well
console.log("test 2"); // like this

// then there is multi-line comments
// you have to write /* at the start and */ at the end
/*
console.log("test 3");
console.log("test 3.1");
console.log("test 3.2");
console.log("test 3.3");
console.log("test 3.4");
console.log("test 3.5");
*/
// like that
// also can use it inside code
console.log("test 4",/*"test 5", */"tests 6");

// ok somethings have happened, lets see if its ok now
